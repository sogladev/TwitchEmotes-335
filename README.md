**Known Issues & Adaptations:**
See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sogladev/TwitchEmotes-335/issues) for details.

- [Multiple emotes sizing/glitches](https://github.com/sogladev/TwitchEmotes-335/issues/1):
  Using several emotes produced overlap/glitches.
  *Solved by dynamically scaling emotes down when more than one is used.*

- [Autocomplete "Enter" and "Arrow keys" don't work](https://github.com/sogladev/TwitchEmotes-335/issues/2):
  Arrow keys and Enter key do not work due to client API limitations.
  *Workaround: Using Enter to quick-send can be enabled, but may cause a taint error.*

*For detailed technical changes made to ensure 3.3.5a compatibility, see the [changes](https://github.com/sogladev/TwitchEmotes-335/compare/c13a892e4083...main) documented in the git history.*

## Usage

Type emote names in chat as you would on Twitch (e.g., `OMEGALUL`, `Pepega`, `forsenE`).

**Auto-completion:** Type a colon `:` prefix to open a dropdown with all available emotes. Use Tab/Shift-Tab to navigate, hit colon again to select, or Enter to quick send.

**Minimap Integration:** Click the minimap button to preview a subset of emote icons. The minimap dropdown only shows emotes from enabled categories, which can be managed in the addon settings using the Favorite List checkboxes. Shift-click the minimap button to open the statistics page.

**Interactive Emotes:** Hover over emotes to see their names, or Shift-click to repost them in chat.

## WIM (WoW Instant Messenger) Support

TwitchEmotes-335 includes full support for WIM 3.3.7. However, **WIM's built-in emoticon system must be disabled** for TwitchEmotes to work properly.

**To enable TwitchEmotes support in WIM:**

1. Open WIM settings: `/wim`
2. Navigate to **General** â†’ **Message Formatting**
3. **Uncheck "Display Emoticons"**

*With WIM's emoticons disabled, TwitchEmotes will handle all emote processing in whisper windows, including full animation support.*
